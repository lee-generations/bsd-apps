https://caddyserver.com

### Command to fetch script

```

Don't forget to
```
chmod +x caddy-install.sh
```

## Notes
- this script will build caddy and configure it using one of the certificate options below. It is a script that should be used as
  - a reverse proxy
  - a webserver instance to serve https
- it will simply build and prepare caddy so users can put it in front of a web application
- it can be run in the same jail as another web application and configured to serve the application via http/https (whichever option you enable below)

## Variables
These are the variables that are available to change along with their defaults and a description of what they do. Other variables should be left at defalut unless you have a good reason to change them.

HOST_NAME
- sets the hostname to use for the webserver
- must be set to your FQDN ie: my.domain.com

### Cerificate Configuration

Caddy is a webserver that can do automatic TLS and HTTPS for you. You should enable one AND ONLY ONE of the following 4 CERT confiurations to tell the script how you want Caddy to work.

NO_CERT
- no certificate, http access only

STANDALONE_CERT
- fully working cert, must own a domain, and have ports 80 and 443 forwarded to your jail

SELFSIGNED_CERT
- generates a self-signed cert for use with https

DNS_CERT 
- DNS validated cert, https access
- must be used together with CERT_EMAIL DNS_TOKEN and DNS_PLUGIN
- must own a domain that allows DNS validation
- will generate a DNS validated cert

DNS_PLUGIN
- set this to a supported DNS plugin, see caddy docs for details
- only used with DNS_CERT

DNS_TOKEN
- must have "Zone / Zone / Read" and "Zone / DNS / Edit" permissions on the domain you are using with Caddy)
- only used with DNS_CERT 

CERT_EMAIL
- your email to receive cert expiry
- used with DNS_CERT and STANDALONE_CERT

If you do use any type of certificate with a domain, Caddy will obtain a staging certificate to not excede rate limits. Once you have confirmed things are working, run the script at `/root/remove-staging.sh` to acquire a valid certificate.

All of the above variables should be changed to fit your environment.

## Mount points (should be mounted outside the jail)
- none

## Jail Properties
- none
